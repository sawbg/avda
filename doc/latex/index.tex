\subsection*{Introduction}

The Automatic Vasospasm Detection Application (or Algorithm, depending on the usage), A\+V\+D\+A, is an application to objectively detect the presence of vasospasms based on comparisons of parameters extracted from transcranial doppler audio.

\subsection*{Setup}

A\+V\+D\+A is intended to be compiled on machines running Linux, though it could likely be adapter for other environments. It must be downloaded from Git\+Hub.\+com and compiled locally. To do this, navigate to the directory in which A\+V\+D\+A should be placed, then execute the following commands \begin{DoxyVerb}git clone https://github.com/sawbg/avda
cd avda
make
\end{DoxyVerb}


Sucessfully cloning, compilation, and execution of A\+V\+D\+A requires up-\/to-\/date versions of the following executables\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item git
\item make
\item gcc (4.\+9)
\item arecord
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{F\+A\+Q}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Why was this project developed?} This project was developed as a course project by two gradute students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Engineering, Nicholas Nolan and Andrew Wisner.
\item {\bfseries Is A\+V\+D\+A an active project?} Though it is not planned to develop A\+V\+D\+A further in the near future, it is hoped that the algorithm discovered and implemented can be used and built upon by researchers to fully automate the detection of vasospasms.
\item {\bfseries A\+V\+D\+A is returning unusually low or high parameters. Why might this be?} In development, this occured when the mic-\/in volume was set too high. It is likely in this senario that clipping is happening or that the signal (or a strong enough signal) has no been received.
\item {\bfseries How will A\+V\+D\+A be affected by the machine uprising?} The University supercomputer, Cheaha, has assured us that A\+V\+D\+A will not be needed after the uprising occures.
\item {\bfseries What about more specific questions?} Questions relating to A\+V\+D\+A not covered in this F\+A\+Q may be sent to the A\+V\+D\+A team via \href{mailto:awisner94@gmail.com}{\tt awisner94@gmail.\+com}.
