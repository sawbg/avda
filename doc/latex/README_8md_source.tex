00001 # vasospasm-detector
00002 
00003 ## Introduction
00004 The Automatic Vasospasm Detection Application (or Algorithm, depending on the
00005 usage), AVDA, is an application to objectively detect the presence of vasospasms
00006 based on comparisons of parameters extracted from transcranial doppler audio.
00007 
00008 ## Setup
00009 AVDA is intended to be compiled on machines running Linux, though it could
00010 likely be adapter for other environments. It must be downloaded from GitHub.com
00011 and compiled locally. To do this, navigate to the directory in which AVDA should
00012 be placed, then execute the following commands
00013 
00014    git clone https://github.com/sawbg/avda
00015    cd avda
00016    make
00017 
00018 Sucessfully cloning, compilation, and execution of AVDA requires up-to-date
00019 versions of the following executables:
00020 
00021 * git
00022 * make
00023 * gcc (4.9)
00024 * arecord
00025 
00026 ## FAQ
00027 
00028 * **Why was this project developed?** This project was developed as a course 
00029 project by two gradute students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
00030 School of Engineering, Nicholas Nolan and Andrew Wisner.
00031 
00032 * **Is AVDA an active project?** Though it is not planned to develop AVDA
00033 further in the near future, it is hoped that the algorithm discovered and
00034 implemented can be used and built upon by researchers to fully automate the
00035 detection of vasospasms.
00036 
00037 * **AVDA is returning unusually low or high parameters. Why might this be?** In
00038   development, this occured when the mic-in volume was set too high. It is
00039 likely in this senario that clipping is happening or that the signal (or a
00040 strong enough signal) has no been received.
00041 
00042 * **How will AVDA be affected by the machine uprising?** The University
00043   supercomputer, Cheaha, has assured us that AVDA will not be needed after the
00044 uprising occures.
00045 
00046 * **What about more specific questions?** Questions relating to AVDA not
00047 covered in this FAQ may be sent to the AVDA team via awisner94@gmail.com.

00049 ## License
00050 
00051                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
00052                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
00053 
00054  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
00055  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
00056  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
00057 
00058                             Preamble
00059 
00060   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
00061 software and other kinds of works.
00062 
00063   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
00064 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
00065 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
00066 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
00067 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
00068 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
00069 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
00070 your programs, too.
00071 
00072   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
00073 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
00074 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
00075 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
00076 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
00077 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
00078 
00079   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
00080 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
00081 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
00082 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
00083 
00084   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
00085 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
00086 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
00087 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
00088 know their rights.
00089 
00090   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
00091 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
00092 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
00093 
00094   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
00095 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
00096 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
00097 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
00098 authors of previous versions.
00099 
00100   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
00101 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
00102 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
00103 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
00104 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
00105 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
00106 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
00107 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
00108 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
00109 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
00110 
00111   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
00112 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
00113 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
00114 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
00115 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
00116 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
00117 
00118   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
00119 modification follow.
00120 
00121                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
00122 
00123   0. Definitions.
00124 
00125   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
00126 
00127   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
00128 works, such as semiconductor masks.
00129 
00130   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
00131 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
00132 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
00133 
00134   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
00135 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
00136 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
00137 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
00138 
00139   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
00140 on the Program.
00141 
00142   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
00143 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
00144 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
00145 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
00146 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
00147 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
00148 
00149   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
00150 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
00151 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
00152 
00153   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
00154 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
00155 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
00156 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
00157 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
00158 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
00159 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
00160 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
00161 
00162   1. Source Code.
00163 
00164   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
00165 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
00166 form of a work.
00167 
00168   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
00169 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
00170 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
00171 is widely used among developers working in that language.
00172 
00173   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
00174 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
00175 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
00176 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
00177 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
00178 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
00179 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
00180 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
00181 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
00182 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
00183 
00184   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
00185 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
00186 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
00187 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
00188 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
00189 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
00190 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
00191 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
00192 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
00193 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
00194 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
00195 subprograms and other parts of the work.
00196 
00197   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
00198 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
00199 Source.
00200 
00201   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
00202 same work.
00203 
00204   2. Basic Permissions.
00205 
00206   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
00207 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
00208 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
00209 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
00210 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
00211 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
00212 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
00213 
00214   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
00215 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
00216 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
00217 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
00218 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
00219 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
00220 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
00221 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
00222 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
00223 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
00224 
00225   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
00226 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
00227 makes it unnecessary.
00228 
00229   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
00230 
00231   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
00232 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
00233 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
00234 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
00235 measures.
00236 
00237   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
00238 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
00239 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
00240 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
00241 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
00242 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
00243 technological measures.
00244 
00245   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
00246 
00247   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
00248 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
00249 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
00250 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
00251 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
00252 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
00253 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
00254 
00255   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
00256 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
00257 
00258   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
00259 
00260   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
00261 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
00262 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
00263 
00264     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
00265     it, and giving a relevant date.
00266 
00267     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
00268     released under this License and any conditions added under section
00269     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
00270     "keep intact all notices".
00271 
00272     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
00273     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
00274     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
00275     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
00276     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
00277     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
00278     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
00279 
00280     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
00281     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
00282     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
00283     work need not make them do so.
00284 
00285   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
00286 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
00287 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
00288 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
00289 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
00290 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
00291 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
00292 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
00293 parts of the aggregate.
00294 
00295   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
00296 
00297   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
00298 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
00299 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
00300 in one of these ways:
00301 
00302     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
00303     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
00304     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
00305     customarily used for software interchange.
00306 
00307     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
00308     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
00309     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
00310     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
00311     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
00312     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
00313     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
00314     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
00315     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
00316     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
00317     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
00318 
00319     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
00320     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
00321     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
00322     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
00323     with subsection 6b.
00324 
00325     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
00326     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
00327     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
00328     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
00329     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
00330     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
00331     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
00332     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
00333     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
00334     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
00335     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
00336     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
00337 
00338     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
00339     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
00340     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
00341     charge under subsection 6d.
00342 
00343   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
00344 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
00345 included in conveying the object code work.
00346 
00347   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
00348 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
00349 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
00350 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
00351 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
00352 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
00353 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
00354 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
00355 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
00356 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
00357 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
00358 the only significant mode of use of the product.
00359 
00360   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
00361 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
00362 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
00363 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
00364 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
00365 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
00366 modification has been made.
00367 
00368   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
00369 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
00370 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
00371 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
00372 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
00373 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
00374 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
00375 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
00376 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
00377 been installed in ROM).
00378 
00379   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
00380 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
00381 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
00382 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
00383 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
00384 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
00385 protocols for communication across the network.
00386 
00387   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
00388 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
00389 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
00390 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
00391 unpacking, reading or copying.
00392 
00393   7. Additional Terms.
00394 
00395   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
00396 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
00397 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
00398 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
00399 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
00400 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
00401 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
00402 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
00403 
00404   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
00405 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
00406 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
00407 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
00408 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
00409 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
00410 
00411   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
00412 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
00413 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
00414 
00415     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
00416     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
00417 
00418     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
00419     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
00420     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
00421 
00422     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
00423     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
00424     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
00425 
00426     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
00427     authors of the material; or
00428 
00429     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
00430     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
00431 
00432     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
00433     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
00434     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
00435     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
00436     those licensors and authors.
00437 
00438   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
00439 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
00440 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
00441 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
00442 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
00443 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
00444 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
00445 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
00446 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
00447 
00448   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
00449 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
00450 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
00451 where to find the applicable terms.
00452 
00453   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
00454 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
00455 the above requirements apply either way.
00456 
00457   8. Termination.
00458 
00459   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
00460 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
00461 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
00462 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
00463 paragraph of section 11).
00464 
00465   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
00466 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
00467 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
00468 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
00469 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
00470 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
00471 
00472   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
00473 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
00474 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
00475 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
00476 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
00477 your receipt of the notice.
00478 
00479   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
00480 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
00481 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
00482 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
00483 material under section 10.
00484 
00485   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
00486 
00487   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
00488 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
00489 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
00490 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
00491 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
00492 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
00493 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
00494 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
00495 
00496   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
00497 
00498   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
00499 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
00500 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
00501 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
00502 
00503   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
00504 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
00505 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
00506 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
00507 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
00508 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
00509 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
00510 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
00511 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
00512 
00513   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
00514 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
00515 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
00516 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
00517 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
00518 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
00519 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
00520 
00521   11. Patents.
00522 
00523   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
00524 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
00525 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
00526 
00527   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
00528 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
00529 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
00530 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
00531 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
00532 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
00533 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
00534 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
00535 this License.
00536 
00537   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
00538 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
00539 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
00540 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
00541 
00542   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
00543 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
00544 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
00545 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
00546 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
00547 patent against the party.
00548 
00549   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
00550 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
00551 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
00552 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
00553 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
00554 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
00555 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
00556 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
00557 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
00558 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
00559 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
00560 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
00561 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
00562 
00563   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
00564 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
00565 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
00566 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
00567 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
00568 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
00569 work and works based on it.
00570 
00571   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
00572 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
00573 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
00574 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
00575 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
00576 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
00577 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
00578 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
00579 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
00580 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
00581 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
00582 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
00583 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
00584 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
00585 
00586   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
00587 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
00588 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
00589 
00590   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
00591 
00592   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
00593 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
00594 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
00595 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
00596 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
00597 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
00598 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
00599 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
00600 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
00601 
00602   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
00603 
00604   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
00605 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
00606 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
00607 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
00608 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
00609 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
00610 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
00611 combination as such.
00612 
00613   14. Revised Versions of this License.
00614 
00615   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
00616 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
00617 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
00618 address new problems or concerns.
00619 
00620   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
00621 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
00622 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
00623 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
00624 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
00625 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
00626 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
00627 by the Free Software Foundation.
00628 
00629   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
00630 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
00631 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
00632 to choose that version for the Program.
00633 
00634   Later license versions may give you additional or different
00635 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
00636 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
00637 later version.
00638 
00639   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
00640 
00641   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
00642 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
00643 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
00644 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
00645 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
00646 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
00647 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
00648 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
00649 
00650   16. Limitation of Liability.
00651 
00652   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
00653 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
00654 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
00655 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
00656 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
00657 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
00658 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
00659 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
00660 SUCH DAMAGES.
00661 
00662   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
00663 
00664   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
00665 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
00666 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
00667 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
00668 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
00669 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
00670 
00671                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
00672 
00673             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
00674 
00675   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
00676 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
00677 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
00678 
00679   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
00680 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
00681 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
00682 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
00683 
00684     \{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\}
00685     Copyright (C) \{year\}  \{name of author\}
00686 
00687     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
00688     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
00689     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
00690     (at your option) any later version.
00691 
00692     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
00693     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
00694     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
00695     GNU General Public License for more details.
00696 
00697     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
00698     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
00699 
00700 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
00701 
00702   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
00703 notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
00704 
00705     \{project\}  Copyright (C) \{year\}  \{fullname\}
00706     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
00707     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
00708     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
00709 
00710 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
00711 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
00712 might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
00713 
00714   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
00715 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
00716 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
00717 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
00718 
00719   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
00720 into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
00721 may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
00722 the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
00723 Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
00724 <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
