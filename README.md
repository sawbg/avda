# vasospasm-detector

The aim of this project is to objectively detect the presence of vasospasms
based on comparisons of parameters extracted from transcranial doppler audio.

AVDA is intended to be compiled on machines running Linux, though it could
likely be adapter for other environments. It must be downloaded from GitHub.com
and compiled locally. To do this, navigate to the directory in which AVDA should
be placed, then execute the following commands

	git clone https://github.com/sawbg/avda
	cd avda
	make

Sucessfully cloning, compilation, and execution of AVDA requires up-to-date
versions of the following executables:

* git
* make
* gcc
* arecord

Questions relating to AVDA may be sent to the AVDA team via awisner94@gmail.com.
